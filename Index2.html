        <p> A home's mechanical, electrical and plumbing engineering need to be designed to be as energy efficient and
            sustainable as possible
            to reduce their carbon footprint and save homeowners and renters on utility costs.
            These three technical fields cover the systems that make buildings habitable for humans.
            MEP installations are normally designed together, due to the high degree of interaction between them. A
            homes HVAC system(space heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) keep a comfortable indoor temperature,
            while mechanical ventilation also maintains the inhabitants health by supplying fresh air and filtering
            pollutants.
            Mechanical ventilation also provides a constant supply of fresh air, to keep pollutants at low and safe
            levels.</p>

        <p>Mechanical design involves finding the optimal routes for heat distribution systems:
            air ducts, refrigerant lines, hydronic piping, steam piping, etc. If combustion is used for heating,
            equipment must be properly vented to remove harmful exhaust gases.</p>




        <p>In high-rise constructions, finding the optimal routes for electrical conduit and wiring can save plenty of
            material. There tends to be more design flexibility than with mechanical systems, since electrical circuits
            use less space and can be routed around obstacles more easily. With the aid of MEP design software, conduit
            and wiring can be laid out while minimizing total circuit length, and avoiding location conflicts with
            mechanical and plumbing installations.

            Lighting installations are the electrical system with the highest energy consumption in most buildings. LED
            lighting is frequently recommended by energy consultants, since it achieves typical savings of 30% to 90%,
            depending on the lamp type replaced. Many design software packages can simulate lighting, to determine the
            optimal number of fixtures and their layout.

            HVAC is an area that requires close collaboration between mechanical and electrical engineers:

            Mechanical engineers calculate the space heating and air conditioning loads, to determine equipment
            capacities.
            Electrical engineers design the electrical circuits and protection measures that allow this equipment to
            operate continuously and safely.
            Furnaces and boilers are the main HVAC components that use fossil fuels as an energy source. Air
            conditioners, chillers, air handling systems and hydronic pumps work with electricity in most cases.</p>

        <p>
            The plumbing design process involves a layout of piping routes, similar to ductwork in mechanical design and
            conduit in electrical design.
            MEP engineers use advanced software to simplify the process and avoid clashes.
            Plumbing installations interact with mechanical and electrical systems at many points, and
            collaboration among design teams is important:
            High-rise buildings normally need water booster pumps, which run with electricity.
            Domestic hot water systems normally use a dedicated water heater, or a heat exchanger
            connected to a space heating boiler.

        <p> I identify as a first generation American, proud Latinx Mexican American from The Rio Grande Valley of
            Texas.
            A relatively new New Englander, adjusting to the harsh winters and humid summers of the region, I have come
            to find a home in Boston, MA.
            After being the first in my family to attend and graduate from college, I moved to the Boston area to pursue
            a career as an educator.
            My passion for social justice has informed my professional career trajectory and my work has revolved around
            serving immigrant
            communities from working with immigration attorneys, to working with service workers unions and teaching
            English Language learners in the public school system,
            I have enjoyed my direct service work which informs my entry into the realms of Environmental Justice and
            sustainability in the built environment.
            I come to this work from a community that has historically been undeserved and disinvested in. I approach
            Environmental issues from
            an understanding of intersectional systemic issues that are rooted in a legacy of extractive colonialism,racism
            and classism that needs
            to be addressed holistically if we are to have a sustainable future on this planet. A great reverence for
            the natural world also fuels
            my desire to lessen the negative human impacts to natural habitats and earth's climate and regulation
            systems.
